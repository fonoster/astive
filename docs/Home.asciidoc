ATK Developer Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:wiki/GuideGettingStarted[ATK Developer Guide] is written in http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[asciidoc] and the source is published right in this wiki. So, you can edit the documentation right on master, see the Readme for more detail on this. The Asciidoc The http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[Asciidoc cheat-sheet]  is a nice place to start learning about Asciidoc itself.

We convert the asciidoc into an intermediate Docbook format, which then is used to create HTML and PDF versions. If you want to build these yourself you need to install asciidoc on your machine and check out the repository locally using:

....
git clone git@github.com:PhonyTive/astivetoolkit.wiki.git
.... 

Then go into the astivetoolkit.wiki/guide directory, and run:
 
....
asciidoc -a docinfo -b docbook Guide.asciidoc
.... 

This will produce a docbook formatted file called Guide.xml. Now, go back up in the guide directory and run:
 
....
mvn clean install
....

and it will build HTML and PDF versions in the target/guide directory.
